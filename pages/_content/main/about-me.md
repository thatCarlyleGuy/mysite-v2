I'm a Software Engineer with {YEARS_EXP} years of experience and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
My main tech stack is Javascript, React, Redux and Node.js. I'm known for my abilities to take business specifications, turn them into a product and take that product live. I also own a successful property rental business in the beach town of Hermanus, SA.

My career goals are simple: make end-users and developer's lives easier. I strive to continuously learn the technical and leadership skills to make this happen.

Another thing you should know about me: I love cooking and baking! If I work in your office, chances are you would get a surprise treat now and then!
